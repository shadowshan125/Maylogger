# Maylogger

## JUST Another Key Logger

This code implements a simple key logger that captures and saves key presses to a file. The key logger listens for key press events and records the pressed keys in a text file named "collectedKeys.txt". It also provides a way to stop the key logger by pressing the Alt + Shift + Ctrl + Esc combination.

## Prerequisites

To run this code, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- `keyboard`: Used for listening to key press events.

You can install the required libraries by running the following command:

```
pip install keyboard
```

## How it works

The code consists of the following main parts:

1. Importing necessary libraries:
   - `keyboard`: Used for keyboard event handling.
   - `os`: Used for file operations.

2. Defining the callback function for key press events:
   - The `on_key_press` function is called whenever a key is pressed.
   - It checks if the combination Alt + Shift + Ctrl + Esc is pressed to stop the key logger.
   - It prints the pressed key and saves it to the file.

3. Defining the function to save content to a file:
   - The `save_content` function takes the content to be saved and the filename as input.
   - It opens the file in append mode (`'a'`) and writes the content to it.
   - It prints a message indicating the successful save operation.

4. Creating the file to store the pressed keys:
   - The code creates a file named "collectedKeys.txt" or clears the existing content if the file already exists.

5. Starting the keyboard listener:
   - The `keyboard.on_press` method is used to register the `on_key_press` function as the callback for key press events.

6. Keeping the program running:
   - The code enters a `while` loop and continuously checks if the Alt + Shift + Ctrl + Esc combination is pressed.
   - If the combination is detected, the loop breaks, and the program stops.

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries by running `pip install keyboard`.

2. Run the code in a Python environment. `python .\Maylogger.py `

3. The program will start listening for key presses and saving them to the "collectedKeys.txt" file.

4. Press the Alt + Shift + Ctrl + Esc combination to stop the key logger and exit the program.

or you may simply stop the terminal `ctrl + c` or close the terminal 

##Reading the "collectedKeys.txt" File
To facilitate the readability of the "collectedKeys.txt" file generated by the key logger, you can utilize find and replace operations to remove unwanted characters or modify specific key representations. This can help enhance the legibility of the logged keystrokes.

##Replacing Special Characters
Certain keys, such as the spacebar, Ctrl, Shift, or other function keys, may appear as special characters or symbols in the "collectedKeys.txt" file. To make the content more human-readable, you can perform find and replace operations to replace these characters with their corresponding representations.

For example:

Replace the symbol for the space with the word "space".
